===============================

This is a perl script to extract the junctions in a HMMSplicer RAW BED file (i.e. 1 read per BED line) based on the a list of junction strings (i.e. cntg:start:end). It reads th BED file junctions and junctions strings, then it prints the junctions across multiple samples.
